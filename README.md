# Image-Generation-using-DCGAN-and-VAE
Winter in Data Science

This is the official Repository for my WIDS project on Deep Generative Models.
In this project, I have implemented the Deep Convolutional Generative ADversarial Network (DCGAN) on Celeba Dataset and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) on the MNIST Dataset.
Further, in this project, I explored different Probabilistic Generative Models.

One such model is CycleGAN which I used for implementing Neural Style Transfer; converted images to 'Monet' style.
Further, I explored energy based methods, including implementation of a very basic UNet based Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). I have used DDPM on Gravitational Lensing Dataset to generate realistic simulations.
